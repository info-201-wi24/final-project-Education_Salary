# Introduction
In our project, we explore the correlation between regional employment condition and education level. The data are collected globally, we will analyze the general educatoins in each region and see if there is a pattern between that and the employment rate and monthly salary.

We want to know the employment/unemployment situation in each country worldwide. And how is their average salary and disparity? What is the proportion of people completing upper education in each country? In general, we want to discover whether there is any correlation between them.

To answer these questions, we use two datasets where the first one provides information about rate of different education stages acrros the country, and the second one covers the investigation of unemployment rate monthly salary including its minmimum, maximum, average, and median. In our project, we partitioned the data and extract those that focuses on the rate of upper level education, rate of unemployment, and the spread of salary.

Additionally, there are also ethical consideration and limitations of data analysis that cannot be ignored. The accuracy of the data, particularly self-reported education levels and salaries, can vary. Biases may arise if certain groups are more likely to misreport or if there are discrepancies in how data is collected. The dataset may contain sensitive personal information that could compromise the privacy of individuals. Care must be taken to anonymize or aggregate data to protect individuals' identities.

We found our two datasets on kaggle, here are the links of global educations and salaray respectively:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zedataweaver/global-salary-data

In order to perform analysis more explicitly, we combine the two datasets and select several features that are particularly relative to our major question.


# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways
Through our careful study, we started an investigation to discover correlations between education levels and work circumstances throughout the world. Our findings highlight trends that are essential to explaining economic and educational inequality.

Our tool navigates each continent's economic environment, from visualizing unemployment statistics and education rates versus earnings. Higher education levels tends to correlate with better work conditions, indicating a global trend in which education serves as a catalyst for economic opportunity and stability. what's more, The relationship between the income gap and the unemployment rate is not straightforwardly,indicates further researches in variety of factors are necessary. Based on the graphs, it appears that unemployment rates can vary significantly across countries within each continent, it highlights that there is no universal pattern or single economic trend about how unemployment rates distribute globally.

While our application offers a comprehensive view of these relationships, we can't overlook the changing global economy and the evolving nature of education. As such, this project should be seen as a snapshot which allowing further studies to be built.

In conclusion, our project showed the crucial ties between education and employment, promoting a forward-thinking education policy and economic planning to be made. By investing in education, we invest in the future stability and prosperity of our global society.
