# Introduction
In our project, we explore the correlation between regional employment condition and education level. The data are collected globally, we will analyze the general educatoins in each region and see if there is a pattern between that and the employment rate and monthly salary.

We want to know the employment/unemployment situation in each country worldwide. And how is their average salary and disparity? What is the proportion of people completing upper education in each country? In general, we want to discover whether there is any correlation between them.

To answer these questions, we use two datasets where the first one provides information about rate of different education stages acrros the country, and the second one covers the investigation of unemployment rate monthly salary including its minmimum, maximum, average, and median. In our project, we partitioned the data and extract those that focuses on the rate of upper level education, rate of unemployment, and the spread of salary.

Additionally, there are also ethical consideration and limitations of data analysis that cannot be ignored. The accuracy of the data, particularly self-reported education levels and salaries, can vary. Biases may arise if certain groups are more likely to misreport or if there are discrepancies in how data is collected. The dataset may contain sensitive personal information that could compromise the privacy of individuals. Care must be taken to anonymize or aggregate data to protect individuals' identities.

We found our two datasets on kaggle, here are the links of global educations and salaray respectively:

In order to perform analysis more explicitly, we combine the two datasets and select several features that are particularly relative to our major question.
