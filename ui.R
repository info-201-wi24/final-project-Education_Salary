According to our data, Asia is a diverse continent with varying levels of economic development and labor market dynamics. Countries like Japan and South Korea typically have lower unemployment rates due to advanced industrial economies and strong manufacturing sectors. Emerging economies in Asia, such as India and Indonesia, may have higher unemployment rates, particularly in rural areas or among youth, due to factors like underemployment and informal labor markets.
Unemployment rates in Europe vary widely among countries due to differences in economic development, labor market policies, and social welfare systems. Some countries in Northern Europe, such as Germany and the Nordic countries, tend to have lower unemployment rates due to strong social safety nets and active labor market policies. 
The most surprising phenomenon we found in this graph is that the USâ€™s unemployment rate is unexpectedly high.

 earnings. Higher education levels tends to correlate with better work conditions, indicating a global trend in which education 
 serves as a catalyst for economic opportunity and stability. what's more, The relationship between the income gap and the unemployment 
   rate is not straightforwardly,indicates further researches in variety of factors are necessary. Based on the graphs, it appears that 
   unemployment rates can vary significantly across countries within each continent, it highlights that there is no universal pattern
